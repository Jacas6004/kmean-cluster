Certainly! Below is a simple explanation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, which you can include in your README.md file.

## K-Means Clustering Algorithm

### Overview

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (clusters). The goal is to group similar data points together and separate dissimilar points.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Choose the number of clusters (K).
   - Randomly initialize K cluster centroids in the feature space.

2. **Assignment:**
   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.

3. **Update Centroids:**
   - Recalculate the centroid of each cluster as the mean of all points assigned to that cluster.

4. **Repeat:**
   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.
   - Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or after a fixed number of iterations.

### Key Considerations

- **Choice of K:**
  - The number of clusters (K) needs to be specified before running the algorithm.
  - Different values of K can produce different results, and determining the optimal K is often an iterative process or involves domain knowledge.

- **Initialization Sensitivity:**
  - The algorithm's results can be sensitive to the initial placement of centroids.
  - Techniques like K-Means++ are commonly used to improve the initialization.

- **Scaling:**
  - Standardizing or normalizing features is recommended to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.

### Usage in the Code

- **Input:**
  - The algorithm typically takes a dataset as input, where each data point is represented by a set of features.

- **Output:**
  - The output includes the assignment of each data point to a cluster and the final cluster centroids.

- **Visualization:**
  - Scatter plots are commonly used to visualize the clusters and centroids in a 2D or 3D feature space.

### Example Code

- The provided code in this repository demonstrates how to implement K-Means clustering using the scikit-learn library in Python.
